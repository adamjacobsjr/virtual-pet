I decided to make my virtual pet assignment an adopt a rapter from jurassic park. 

The first thing to do in the game is name your rapter.
It then outputs the name and the game loop including the methods.
from there you can choose to feed / water / or play with the rapter. 
The feed option increases the thirst levels but thrist levels do not increase the hunger stat.

When using the play option I made multiple options, sort of. 
In reality the only play option that will allow you to continue the game is fetch. 
the other 2 options close the application.
